### E-Commerce Data Model & Query Showcase

Welcome to a miniature data warehouse simulation

A full-stack SQL playground where I model, populate, and query an e-commerce ecosystem using SQLite and Streamlit, This project showcases my key skills in data modeling, SQL querying, and frontend integration skills.

# Data Modeling

- Designed 10+ relational tables for a fictional e-commerce company

- Used proper normalization and foreign key constraints

- Included metadata and dimensional tables (like product categories & geography)

# Data Loading

- Populated the database with real datasets via .csv â†’ SQL inserts

- Converted PostgreSQL-style COPY logic to SQLite-compatible inserts

# Querying

- Supports basic and advanced SQL operations:

- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

- Complex JOINs

- Aggregate queries

- Includes 10+ pre-written SQL query examples

- Supports user-triggered query execution from a dropdown

# Web Interface with Streamlit

- Explore database tables

- Run sample SQL queries

- View results directly in a browser

- Fully deployed and publicly accessible

# Live Demo
